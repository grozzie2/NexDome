Wiring for the Rotation and Shutter controllers is almost identical with minor differences.

System ground is the ground lug on the 12V power plug.  Ground goes to

- GND on the motor controller
- PUL- on the motor controller
- DIR- on the motor controller
- ENA- on the motor controller
- GND on the arduino
- GND side of both buttons
- Ground end of the voltage divider

12V comes in on the 12V jack to the power bus.  The 12V power goes to

-  VCC on the stepper motor controller
-  Vin on the Arduino
-  A voltage divider to present 4V on the arduino A0 analog input

The voltage divider is a simple resistor configuration to give a 4V tap for measuring battery state.  Using large resistor values the current draw is near zero.  The voltage divider is made up with a series of 3 identical resistors between the 12V line and ground.  Tapping between the input to the third resistor and ground gives a voltage measurement in the 4V range, ie 1/3 of the input voltage, which is within the range that can be measured by the arduino a/d converter.

Arduino pins are wired as follows

0 - Serial connection to XBee (internal to the board)
1 - Serial connection to XBee (internal to the board)
2 - IRQ sensor (home sensor on rotator, open sensor for shutter)
3 - IRQ sensor (unused on rotator, closed sensor for shutter)
4 - low power LED.
5 - Button
6 - Button
7 - RG-11
8 - Reserved
9 - Reserved
10 - Motor Controller ENA+
11 - Motor Controller DIR+
12 - Motor Controller PUL+ (Step)
13 - On board Led - not used by NexDome
A0 - Optional analog input for measuring battery voltage


The motor controller has 6 switches which should be configured as follows

To set the microstepping mode to 8
S1 - OFF
S2 - On
S3 - OFF

Set the current to 2.5 peak 2.7 Amp
S4 - OFF
S5 - On
S6 - On
